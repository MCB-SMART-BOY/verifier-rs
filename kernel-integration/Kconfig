config BPF_VERIFIER_RUST
	bool "Rust implementation of BPF verifier"
	depends on BPF_SYSCALL
	depends on RUST
	default n
	help
	  This option enables the Rust implementation of the BPF verifier
	  as an alternative to the C implementation.

	  The Rust verifier provides the same functionality as the C verifier
	  but with additional compile-time safety guarantees provided by Rust's
	  type system and ownership model.

	  This is currently experimental. When enabled, you can select which
	  verifier to use at runtime via a sysctl parameter.

	  If unsure, say N.

config BPF_VERIFIER_RUST_DEFAULT
	bool "Use Rust BPF verifier by default"
	depends on BPF_VERIFIER_RUST
	default n
	help
	  When enabled, the Rust BPF verifier will be used by default instead
	  of the C verifier. The C verifier remains available as a fallback
	  and can be selected via sysctl.

	  If unsure, say N.

config BPF_VERIFIER_RUST_DEBUG
	bool "Enable Rust BPF verifier debug output"
	depends on BPF_VERIFIER_RUST
	default n
	help
	  Enable verbose debug output from the Rust BPF verifier.
	  This can be useful for debugging verifier issues but may
	  significantly impact performance.

	  If unsure, say N.
